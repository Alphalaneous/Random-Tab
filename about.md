# Random Tab

Adds a random tab in search!

From there you can choose to filter how you wish to randomize your levels.

If you wish to filter by rated only, you can choose the difficulties, do note that difficulty choosing is not supported for the 2.2 version. 2.2 and rated only is not supported for the list of levels gotten by the "Randomize Them!" button.
